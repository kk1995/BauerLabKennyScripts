Data location: Proc2/170126, Proc2/170127
Mice were given stroke.

This data has both GCAMP signal and OIS signal, thus allowing neurovascular coupling analysis.

Goal:
* lag analysis (global lag, projection lag, homotopic lag)
	* Hb
	* gCaMP
	* Hb and gCaMP same frequency (both directions)
* spike-triggered averaging
* Hb gCaMP association in different frequencies
